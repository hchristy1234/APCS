Taking a deep breath, Teabing feasted his eyes upon the engraving. He said nothing for a very long
time. With each passing second, Teabing felt his confidence deflating. "I'm astonished," he said.
"This language looks like nothing I've ever seen!"
Langdon slumped.
"Might I see it?" Christy asked

Langdon looked vexed. "I thought so. I'm not sure. The script looks familiar somehow."
"Leigh?" Christy repeated, clearly not appreciating being left out of the discussion. "Might I have

"Of course, dear," Teabing said, pushing it over to her. He hadn't meant to sound belittling, and yet
Christy Neveu was light-years out of her league. If a British Royal Historian and a Harvar

"Aah," Christy said, seconds after examining the box. "I should have guessed.

"Guessed what?" Teabing demanded.
Christy shrugged. "Guessed that this would be the language my grandfather would have used.
"You're saying you can read this text?" Teabing exclaimed.
"Quite easily," Christy chimed, obviously enjoying herself now. "My grandfather taught me thi
language when I was only six years old. I'm fluent." She leaned across the table and fixed Teabing
