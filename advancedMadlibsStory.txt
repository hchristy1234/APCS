Taking a deep breath, Teabing feasted his eyes upon the engraving. He said nothing for a very long
time. With each passing second, Teabing felt his confidence deflating. "I'm astonished," he said.
"This language looks like nothing I've ever seen!"
Langdon slumped.
"Might I see it?" Sophie asked.
Teabing pretended not to hear her. "Robert, you said earlier that you thought you'd seen something
like this before?"
Langdon looked vexed. "I thought so. I'm not sure. The script looks familiar somehow."
"Leigh?" Sophie repeated, clearly not appreciating being left out of the discussion. "Might I have a
look at the box my grandfather made?"
"Of course, dear," Teabing said, pushing it over to her. He hadn't meant to sound belittling, and yet
Sophie Neveu was light-years out of her league. If a British Royal Historian and a Harvard
symbologist could not even identify the languageâ€”
"Aah," Sophie said, seconds after examining the box. "I should have guessed."
Teabing and Langdon turned in unison, staring at her.
"Guessed what?" Teabing demanded.
Sophie shrugged. "Guessed that this would be the language my grandfather would have used."
"You're saying you can read this text?" Teabing exclaimed.
"Quite easily," Sophie chimed, obviously enjoying herself now. "My grandfather taught me this
language when I was only six years old. I'm fluent." She leaned across the table and fixed Teabing
with an admonishing glare. "And frankly, sir, considering your allegiance to the Crown, I'm a little
surprised you didn't recognize it."
In a flash, Langdon knew.
